    <h1 class="st">Solar Energy And It's Working</h1>
    <p class="gr">Solar energy is one of the most abundant sources of energy available. 
        Solar energy is the energy that is in sunlight. Solar technologies can be used to generate electricity. 
        Solar technologies are becoming more efficient and less expensive and it is being used in an increasingly diverse range of applications.
Solar energy is one of the most popular forms of renewable energy.
 It is considered to be a clean source of energy because it does not produce emissions.
  Solar technologies have the potential to contribute significantly to the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
   Solar power is also considered to be a very secure form of energy, as there are no moving parts and no fuel.
   Solar panels are used to capture the sun’s energy and convert it into electricity.
    Solar panels are usually made of silicon, a material that is very good at absorbing sunlight.
     The sunlight hits the solar panel and produces an electrical current. 
     This current is then sent to an inverter, which converts the DC into AC.
      The AC can then be used to power your home or business.
       Solar panels are a great way to reduce your carbon footprint and save money on your electricity bill.</p>

        <p class="gr">Policy infrastructure in the renewable energy sector in India took shape with the foundation of the Commission of Alternate 
            Sources of Energy (CASE) in 1981, in the Department of Science & Technology. It became an independent Department of New Energy Sources
             (DNES) in 1982 and a full-fledged Ministry in 1992.The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is the nodal Ministry of the
              Government of India for all matters relating to new and renewable energy. The broad aim of the ministry is to develop and deploy
               new and renewable energy for supplementing the energy requirements of the country. They provide direct and indirect tax benefits 
               such as sales tax, excise duty exemptions, and custom duty exemptions.</p>

               <h1 class="st">Communities Envolvement In Solar Energy Projects</h1>
               <p class="gr"><strong>How Does Community Solar Work :</strong>
                Community solar projects generate electricity from sunlight and the electricity flows through a meter to the utility grid. Community solar subscribers (i.e., households, businesses, or any other electricity customer) pay for a share of the electricity generated by the community solar project. This is typically in the form of a monthly subscription fee. </p>
               <p class="gr"><strong>Benefits of Community Solar :</strong>
            <li>Greater Household Savings</li>

            <h1 class="st">Advantages of Solar Energy</h1>
            <p class="gr"><strong>Energy Source :</strong>
                Fossil fuel remains a resource in declining supply that, when burned to create energy, releases harmful byproducts into our atmosphere. Solar power has the potential to help us minimize our use of fossil fuels and the impact we have on the environment.</p>
            <p class="gr"><strong> Electric Bill :</strong>
                Solar energy can help most consumers power their homes as an alternative or supplement to purchasing electricity from a grid. With power prices on the rise, consumers stand to save a considerable amount on monthly power bills by switching to solar.</p>
            <p class="gr"><strong>Energy Independence :</strong>
                A home reliant entirely on solar power features the capacity to function entirely off-grid, especially when supplemented with a solar battery system to maintain power during non-daylight hours. These battery systems can also turn solar systems into emergency backups during power outages.</p>
            <p class="gr"><strong>Benefits the Community:</strong>A process known as net metering allows consumers to sell excess electricity their panels produce back to the utility company, further reducing utility bills. This often reduces a community’s reliance on fossil fuels, as well.</p>
            <p class="gr"><strong>Technology Is Improving and Prices Are Decreasing :</strong>
                Technology has improved tremendously since the early days of solar power and advancements continue to be made every day. Better yet, despite these advancements, solar’s ubiquity appears to have driven its cost down, making solar more accessible to more consumers. Many state incentive programs and a federal tax credit can also help consumers minimize the out-of-pocket amount they spend on a new solar system.</p>
          
<h1 class="st">Disdvantages of Solar Energy :</h1>
<p class="gr"><strong>High Cost of Solar Panels :</strong>
    Despite decreases in the cost of solar panels over the past ten years, a complete solar installation still requires significant investment. On average, a consumer can expect to pay around $18,000 on a complete solar setup for a home before accounting for any incentives and the federal solar tax credit.</p>
<p class="gr"><strong> Impact of Manufacturing :</strong>
    The production of solar technology has its environmental downsides, as the mining of materials and manufacturing of solar panels creates a considerable amount of greenhouse gas. The Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy issued a report revealing that solar panels pay for themselves in terms of greenhouse gas emissions within one to four years of use, so while certainly still a downside, much of the issue can be mitigated.</p>
<p class="gr"><strong>Sunlight Dependent :</strong>
    Without sunlight, a system reliant on solar energy cannot produce power. This can pose a problem for consumers in areas with less-than-ideal levels of sun exposure or poor weather. Solar batteries to store excess energy can help mitigate this issue and even under constant-clouds the best solar panels will still remain cost and energy efficient enough to be worth the installation.</p>
<p class="gr"><strong>Disposal or Recycling Options :</strong>
    Solar technology contains some of the same environmentally-harmful substances in many consumer and industrial electronics, so proper disposal is critical. At present, recycling options for solar panels remain limited.</p>
